I like the idea of a uses page, if not for anyone else but myself. It feels good to keep a list of everything in one place if I break something and need to replace it. I'm not really set on much, and will probably end up updating it a lot, so I've decided to populate it as a table. The table is nice because it can be sorted by date, category and link to the product.

I'm pretty happy with the hardware setup, it's nothing too fancy or particularly exciting. Macbook, Lots of heavy machinery surrounding it. Ultrawide monitor. Record player. Air purifier. PS4. etc. Its all in the list.

Regarding productivity software I think too often I switch trying to find the optimal stack. Is it notion + trello, or clickup, or apple notes and calendar, or maybe just excel. Nothing is perfect but right now I'm keeping it pretty simple with the new apple stuff. Always tend to go back to that.
